ALFEA adds Finite Element Analysis capabilities to turbinesFoam, a library for simulating wind and marine hydrokinetic turbines
in OpenFOAM using the actuator line method.

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are very welcome!
See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/petebachant/turbinesFoam/issues)
for more details.


Features
--------

`fvOptions` classes for adding actuator lines and turbines constructed from
actuator lines to any compatible solver or turbulence model, e.g.,
`simpleFoam`, `pimpleFoam`, `interFoam`, etc.


Installation
------------
Tested in OF-8 and OF-7.

Requires the Armadillo library:
http://arma.sourceforge.net/

Before installing Armadillo, first install OpenBLAS and LAPACK, along with the corresponding development/header files
     
Recommended packages to install before installing Armadillo:
        Fedora & Red Hat: cmake, openblas-devel, lapack-devel, arpack-devel, SuperLU-devel
        Ubuntu & Debian: cmake, libopenblas-dev, liblapack-dev, libarpack2-dev, libsuperlu-dev

Pre-built Armadillo packages are provided by many Linux-based operating systems: Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch
the pre-built packages may not be the latest version; if you're encountering problems, use the official stable version provided here


```bash
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
git clone https://github.com/turbinesFoam/turbinesFoam.git
cd turbinesFoam
./Allwmake
```


Usage
-----

There are tutorials located in `turbinesFoam/tutorials`.
Each case contains an Allrun and Allclean script. 
Results can be plotted against analytical solutions using the GNUoctave toolbox and the ComparAnalyticalsolution.m script files.

Test cases for ALFEA:

tutorials/actuatorLine/bendingtestFEA
 demonstrates bending deformation of a flexible wing 

tutorials/actuatorLine/torsiontestFEA
 demonstrates torsional deformation of a beam supporting a wing

tutorials/actuatorLine/changeAoA
 demonstrates change in angle of attack by the bending deformation of the support structure of a wing
 fixedAoA runs the same case but for a "stiff" support structure for comprison
